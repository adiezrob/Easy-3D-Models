# Easy-3D-Models

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI method that takes an input string and makes a 3D model (or ideally various 3D models) of what was described in the text.


## Background
This method would allow people to easily make 3D models of objects without needing any knowledge of 3D modeling while at the same time serving as a better starting point for projects for people who do know how to 3D model and have something in mind. Basically, this idea would come in useful when digital artists, architects or just people who need to make a 3D model need inspiration or a better starting point for a 3D object or shape. 3D artists could use this to start their models from a shape that already resembles what they want to a achieve and that way would save time every time they start a project. This could have a big impact on 3D artists who work on 3D models every day and a smaller but still notable impact on people's personal projects such as 3D printing things for fun or as a hobby.

My main motivaiton is just that I think this idea would be really cool to have (especially combined with a 3D printer) and that a lot of people could use this idea either to make their work easier, faster and lighter or to use it in creative and innovative ways and inspire them to make other cool projects.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The user would type the specification or description of an object they want a 3D model of as well as maybe the (more or less) dimensions of the object. Then, the method would return a 3D file of what was described, so that if the person using the method wanted to change the model or play around with it, they could.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:


The data source would be free 3D models of objects from the internet. To create this with the AI methods we have today I imagine we would have to use OpenAI's DALL-E to create images from text and feed its output to an AI method that creates 3D models of 2D images.

In the future, maybe this could be changed and the method could directly make the models without having to create the images first. But that is the only way I could imagine this existing in the next few years.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 

This project is way out of my reach. I think this idea resembles something an AI company would do more than something a person would do on their own in their free time or as a side project. DALL-E isn't even available to the public other than a controlled demo and a lot of the methods that create 3D models of 2D pictures do so of humans, as opposed to any type of object. This is definitely a project for the future.
